utimes support was forked with modifications from the docker project:
  https://github.com/docker/docker/tree/master/pkg/system

The upstream license is also Apache2, and we continue our modifications
under the same license.

We happily credit the origin of this code to those fine authors.  We regret
any inconvenience in historical tracking; we'd prefer to maintain a proper
hashed linkage to the original repository and reuse the code as a library
directly, but ~100 megs (compressed) of vendored unrelated deps in that repo
makes that untenable.    ヽ(´ー｀)ノ
